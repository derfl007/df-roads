# Roads by derfl007
This is a mod that implements road blocks and signs into Minecraft 1.12.2


Update 1.5.4 (by E__Man's Application)

* Crafts for different heights:

  - Build a 0.75-height road block with previously added crafts.

  - Put three 0.75-height blocks in a row (like for vanilla slabs) to get nine 0.25-height blocks
  - Put two 0.5-height blocks in a row to get four 0.25-height blocks
  - Put two 1-height blocks in a row to get four 0.5-height blocks
  - Put two 0.25-height blocks one above the other to get one 0.5-height block.
  - Put three 0.25-height blocks vertically (in a column) to get one 0.75-height block.
  - Put two 0.5-height blocks one above the other to get one 1-height block.


* How to make slopes?

  - Put a road block under the slope. The block under must have an height equal or greater than the slope-block.
  - Put a block with a lower height in front of the slope, without blocks under or above.
